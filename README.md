# EGameCafe SPA 

In this repo we implement UI layer with blazor server side frame work. 

## What is blaozr ? 

Blazor lets you build interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript. Blazor apps are composed of reusable web UI components implemented using C#, HTML, and CSS. Both client and server code is written in C#, allowing you to share code and libraries.
